# Fact Sheet #26G: H-2A Housing Standards for Rental and Public Accommodations

**November 2022**

On April 29, 2024, The U.S. Department of Labor published a final rule, “[Improving Protections for Workers in Temporary Agricultural Employment in the United States](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2024/04/29/2024-08333/improving-protections-for-workers-in-temporary-agricultural-employment-in-the-united-states)”

This Fact Sheet provides general information about the housing safety and health standards that apply to rental and public accommodations used by employers to house workers under H-2A temporary labor certifications approved on or after November 14, 2022.

## Introduction

The Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) authorizes the lawful admission of temporary, nonimmigrant workers (H-2A workers) to perform agricultural labor or services of a temporary or seasonal nature when the employer demonstrates that there are not sufficient workers who are able, willing, qualified, and available, and that the employment of the H-2A workers will not adversely affect the wages and working conditions of workers similarly employed in the U.S. As part of the recruitment process, the H-2A employer must submit information for the publication and circulation of a job order, which is the document containing the material condition of employment. The Department of Labor's (DOL) regulations governing the H-2A visa program also apply to the employment of other workers by the H-2A employer to perform any work included in the job order that was approved by DOL's Employment and Training Administration (ETA) or any agricultural work performed by the H-2A workers during the period of employment stated on the job order. These other workers are engaged in corresponding employment.

Information about other H-2A requirements can be found in Fact Sheets #26, #26A, #26B, #26C, #26D, #26E, #26F and #26G.

## Housing Obligations

H-2A employers must provide housing at no cost to H-2A workers and to those workers in corresponding employment who are not reasonably able to return to their residence within the same day. H-2A employers may house workers in temporary labor camps that they own or control, or they may use rental or public accommodations, such as hotels or motels. See WHD's Housing Safety and Health Standards Checklists for the Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA) standards and for the Employment and Training Administration (ETA) standards to learn more about the housing standards that apply to temporary labor camps under the H-2A program.

H-2A employers that use hotels, motels, or other similar public accommodations to house workers must ensure that those accommodations meet certain essential health and safety concerns, summarized below. Where local health and safety standards for rental and/or public accommodations exist, all of those local standards will apply. If, however, the local standards do not address any one or more of these essential concerns, then any state standards addressing those concerns will apply on that issue. If neither local nor state standards address any one or more of these essential concerns, then the relevant OSHA standards that pertain to those concerns will apply.

***Example:*** If an employer houses workers in a motel located in a county with a local code that addresses all but one of the listed health and safety concerns, such as a minimum square footage requirement, then all of the standards in the local code apply to the motel. Since the local code has no minimum number of square feet per occupant, the State standard for the minimum number of square feet per occupant, if any, applies to the housing as well. If the State has no standard for the minimum number of square feet per occupant, then the OSHA standard applies.

## Health or Safety Concerns That Must Be Addressed

Unless the following essential health and safety concerns are addressed by applicable local or state health and safety standards, the indicated federal DOL OSHA standards will apply to rental and public accommodations used to house workers under the H-2A program. The employer is responsible for compliance with all the applicable standards, including those that require cleaning.
