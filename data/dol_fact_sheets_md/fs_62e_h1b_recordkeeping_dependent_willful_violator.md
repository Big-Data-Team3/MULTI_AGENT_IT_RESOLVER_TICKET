**Revised July 2008**

This fact sheet provides general information concerning additional recordkeeping requirements for H-1B-dependent and willful violator employers under the H-1B program. Special attestations applicable to H-1B-dependent and willful violator employers sunset on October 1, 2003, but were restored effective March 8, 2005 by the H-1B Visa Reform Act of 2004.

In addition to the records generally maintained by all H-1B employers (see [WH Fact Sheet #62D](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/fact-sheets/62d-h1b-recordkeeping)), any H-1B-dependent or willful violator employer must keep the following records:

   * B. the employer attests that it is not dependent but does not meet the “snap-shot” test; or
   * C. the employer’s status changed from dependent to non-dependent; or
   * D. the employer utilizes the snap-shot or full calculation of status when claiming “single employer” or “group of businesses” status from the Department of Homeland Security’s U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) (formerly the Immigration and Naturalization Service) (See [WH Fact Sheet #62C](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/fact-sheets/62c-h1b-dependent-employer)).

5. If operating as a contractor and arranging for an H-1B worker to work at another employer’s work site:
   * A. Written communication or contract language with secondary employer re: U.S. worker displacement; and/or
   * B. Contemporaneous written note of secondary employer’s oral statement re: U.S. worker displacement; and
6. Name, last-known address, personnel records, pay records, and anything created/received concerning U.S. worker hiring/firing/departing at or near the time of filing USCIS H-1B petition (See [WH Fact Sheet #62N](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/fact-sheets/62n-h1b-displacement)).
