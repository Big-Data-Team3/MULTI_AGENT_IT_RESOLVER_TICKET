# Fact Sheet #38: Child Labor Rules for Employing Youth in Grocery Stores under the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA)

**Revised July 2010**

This fact sheet provides general information concerning the application of the federal child labor provisions to grocery stores and supermarkets that employ workers who are less than 18 years of age. For detailed information about the federal child labor provisions, please read Regulations, [29 CFR Part 570](https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/retrieveECFR?gp=&SID=de1714a8dd5fa0562890ed096a83e486&mc=true&n=pt29.3.570&r=PART&ty=HTML).

The Department of Labor is committed to helping young workers find positive, appropriate, and safe employment experiences. The child labor provisions of the FLSA were enacted to ensure that when young people work, the work does not jeopardize their health, well-being, or educational opportunities. Working youth are generally entitled to the same minimum wage and overtime protections as older adults. For information about the minimum wage and overtime requirements in the grocery store and supermarket industries, please see [Fact Sheet 6](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/fact-sheets/6-flsa-retail) in this series, *The Retail Industry under the Fair Labor Standards Act*.

## Minimum Age Standards for Employment

The [FLSA](/agencies/whd/flsa) and the child labor regulations, issued at [29 CFR Part 570](https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/retrieveECFR?gp=&SID=de1714a8dd5fa0562890ed096a83e486&mc=true&n=pt29.3.570&r=PART&ty=HTML), establish both hours and occupational standards for youth. Youth of any age are generally permitted to work for businesses entirely owned by their parents, except those under 16 may not be employed in mining or manufacturing and no one under 18 may be employed in any occupation the Secretary of Labor has declared to be hazardous.

## Work Experience and Career Exploration Program (WECEP)

WECEP is a program designed to provide a carefully planned work experience and career exploration program for 14- and 15-year-old youths who can benefit from a career oriented educational program designed to meet the participants& needs, interests and abilities. The program is aimed at helping youths to become reoriented and motivated toward education and to prepare them for the world of work.

State Departments of Education are granted approval to operate a WECEP by the Administrator of the Wage and Hour Division for a 2-year period. Certain provisions of child labor provisions are modified for 14- and 15-year-old participants during the school term.

* They may work during school hours.
* They may work up to 3 hours on a school day; and as many as 23 hours in a school week.

Individual employers may partner with participating local school districts in those states authorized to operate WECEPs

## Work-Study Program (WSP)

WSP is a program designed to help academically oriented students enrolled in a college preparatory high school curriculum pursue their college diplomas. Some of the hours standards provisions of Child Labor Regulation No. 3 are varied for certain 14- and 15-year-old students participating in a Department of Labor approved and school-supervised and administered WSP. Participating students must be enrolled in a college preparatory curriculum and identified by authoritative personnel of the school as being able to benefit from the WSP

Students enrolled in an authorized WSP:
