**February 2010**

On April 29, 2024, The U.S. Department of Labor published a final rule, “[Improving Protections for Workers in Temporary Agricultural Employment in the United States](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2024/04/29/2024-08333/improving-protections-for-workers-in-temporary-agricultural-employment-in-the-united-states)”

**This fact sheet provides general information concerning the application of the H-2A requirements to the agricultural industry for H-2A applications submitted on or after March 15, 2010.**

## Introduction

The Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) authorizes the lawful admission of temporary, nonimmigrant workers (H-2A workers) to perform agricultural labor or services of a temporary or seasonal nature. The Department of Labor’s regulations governing the H-2A Program also apply to the employment of U.S. workers by an employer of H-2A workers in any work included in the ETA-approved job order or in any agricultural work performed by the H-2A workers during the period of the job order. Such U.S. workers are engaged in corresponding employment.

## Overview of Employer Contractual Obligations

**Recruitment of U.S. Workers**: In order for the Department of Labor to certify that there are not sufficient U.S. workers qualified and available to perform the labor involved in the petition and that the employment of the foreign worker will not have an adverse effect on the wages and working conditions of similarly employed U.S. workers, employers must demonstrate the need for a specific number of H-2A workers. In addition to contacting certain former U.S. employees and coordinating recruitment activities through the appropriate State Workforce Agency, employers are required to engage in positive recruitment of U.S. workers. H-2A employers must provide employment to any qualified, eligible U.S. worker who applies for the job opportunity until 50 percent of the period of the work contract has elapsed. Employers must offer U.S. workers terms and working conditions which are not less favorable than those offered to H-2A workers.

**Termination of Workers**: Employers are prohibited from hiring H-2A workers if the employer laid off U.S. workers within 60 days of the date of need, unless the laid-off U.S. workers were offered and rejected the agricultural job opportunities for which the H-2A workers were sought. A layoff of U.S. workers in corresponding employment is permissible only if all H-2A workers are laid off first. Employers may only reject eligible U.S. workers for lawful, job-related reasons.

In order to negate a continuing liability for wages and benefits for a worker who is terminated or voluntarily abandons the position, employers are required to notify the Department of Labor (DOL), and in the case of an H-2A worker the Department of Homeland Security, no later than two working days after the termination or abandonment.

**Rates of Pay**: The employer must pay all covered workers at least the highest of the following applicable wage rates in effect at the time work is performed: the adverse effect wage rate (AEWR), the applicable prevailing wage, the agreed-upon collective bargaining rate, or the Federal or State statutory minimum wage.

Wages may be calculated on the basis of hourly or “piece” rates of pay. The piece rate must be no less than the piece rate prevailing for the activity in the area of intended employment and on a pay period basis must average no less than the highest required hourly wage rate.

**Written Disclosure**: No later than the time at which an H-2A worker applies for a visa and no later than on the first (1st) day of work for workers in corresponding employment, the employer must provide each worker a copy of the work contract – in a language understood by the worker – which describes the terms and conditions of employment. In the absence of a separate written work contract, the employer must provide each worker with a copy of the job order that was submitted to and approved by DOL. The work contract must include:

* the beginning and ending dates of the contract period as well as the location(s) of work;
* any and all significant conditions of employment, including payment for transportation expenses incurred, housing and meals to be provided (and related charges), specific days workers are not required to work (i.e., Sabbath, Federal holidays);
* the hours per day and the days per week each worker will be expected to work;
* the crop(s) to be worked and/or each job to be performed;
* the applicable rate(s) for each crop/job;
* that any required tools, supplies, and equipment will be provided at no charge;
* that workers’ compensation insurance will be provided at no charge; and
* any deductions not otherwise required by law. All deductions must be reasonable. Any deduction not specified is not permissible.

**Guarantees to All Workers**: H-2A employers must guarantee to offer each covered worker employment for a total number of hours equal to at least 75% of the workdays in the contract period – called the “three-fourths guarantee.” For example, if a contract is for a 10-week period, during which a normal workweek is specified as 6 days a week, 8 hours per day, the worker would need to be guaranteed employment for at least 360 hours (e.g., 10 weeks x 48 hours/week = 480 hours x 75% = 360).

If during the total work contract period the employer does not offer sufficient workdays to the H-2A or corresponding workers to reach the total amount required to meet the three-fourths guarantee, the employer must pay such workers the amount they would have earned had they actually worked for the guaranteed number of workdays. Wages for the guaranteed 75% period will be calculated at no less than the rate stated in the work contract.

**Housing**: Employers must provide housing at no cost to H-2A workers and to workers in corresponding employment who are not reasonably able to return to their residence within the same day. If the employer elects to secure rental (public) accommodations for such workers, the employer is required to pay all housing-related charges directly to the housing’s management.

In addition, employers are required to either provide each covered worker with three meals per day, at no more than a DOL-specified cost, or to furnish free and convenient cooking and kitchen facilities where workers can prepare their own meals.

Employer-provided or secured housing must meet all applicable safety standards.

**Transportation**: Employers must provide daily transportation between the workers’ living quarters and the employer’s worksite at no cost to covered workers living in employer-provided housing. Employer-provided transportation must meet all applicable safety standards, be properly insured, and be operated by licensed drivers.

**Inbound & Outbound Expenses**: If not previously advanced or otherwise provided, the employer must reimburse workers for reasonable costs incurred for inbound transportation and subsistence costs once the worker completes 50% of the work contract period. Note: the FLSA applies independently of H-2A and prohibits covered employees from incurring costs that are primarily for the benefit of the employer if such costs take the employee’s wages below the FLSA minimum wage. Upon completion of the work contract, the employer must either provide or pay for the covered worker’s return transportation and daily subsistence.

**Records Required**: Employers must keep accurate records of the number of hours of work offered each day by the employer and the hours actually worked each day by the worker.

On or before each payday (which must be at least twice monthly), each worker must be given an hours and earnings statement showing hours offered, hours actually worked, hourly rate and/or piece rate of pay, and if piece rates are used, the units produced daily. The hours and earnings statement must also indicate total earnings for the pay period and all deductions from wages.

**Additional Assurances and Obligations**: Employers must comply with all applicable laws and regulations, including the prohibition against holding or confiscating workers’ passports or other immigration documents. In addition, employers must not seek or receive payment of any kind from workers for anything related to obtaining the H-2A labor certification, including the employer’s attorney or agent fees, the application fees, or the recruitment costs. Employers must also assure that there is no strike or lockout in the course of a labor dispute at the worksite for the H-2A certification which the employer is seeking. In addition, employers cannot discriminate against – or discharge without just cause – any person who has filed a complaint, consulted with an attorney or an employee of a legal assistance program, testified, or in any manner, exercised or asserted on behalf of himself/herself or others any right or protection afforded by sec. 218 of the INA or the H-2A regulations.

## H-2A Labor Contractors

An H-2ALC is a person who meets the definition of an “employer” under the H-2A Program and does not otherwise qualify as a fixed-site employer or an agricultural association (or an employee of a fixed-site employer or agricultural association) and who is engaged in any one of the following activities in regards to any worker subject to the H-2A regulations: recruiting, soliciting, hiring, employing, furnishing, housing, or transporting.

While H-2A does not require labor contractors to register as such with the Department, any *person* who is subject to MSPA as a Farm Labor Contractor (FLC) must register with the Department and be issued an FLC Certificate of Registration prior to engaging in any farm labor contracting activity. In their H-2A applications, H-2ALCs required to be registered under MSPA are obligated to provide their respective MSPA FLC Certificate of Registration number and to identify the farm labor contracting activities they are authorized to perform.

In addition to meeting the same assurances and obligations as any other H-2A employer, H-2ALCs must fulfill the following requirements:

* list the name and location of each fixed-site agricultural business to which they expect to provide H-2A workers, the dates of each employment opportunity, and a description of the crops and activities the workers are expected to perform at each area of intended employment;
* submit a copy of each work contract agreement between the H-2ALC and the agricultural business to which they expect to provide workers;
* provide proof that all housing and transportation if provided or secured by the fixed-site employer complies with applicable safety and health standards; and
* obtain and submit the original surety bond with the H-2A Application.

**Surety Bond:** The surety bond must be written to cover liability incurred during the term of the work contract period listed on the H-2A Application and must remain in effect for a period of at least 2 years from the expiration date of the labor certification. H-2ALCs must obtain the surety bond in the following amounts:

* $5,000 for a labor certification with fewer than 25 employees;
* $10,000 for a labor certification with 25 to 49 employees;
* $20,000 for a labor certification with 50 to 74 employees;
* $50,000 for a labor certification with 75 to 99 employees; and
* $75,000 for a labor certification with 100 or more employees.

The bond must be payable to the Administrator, Wage and Hour Division, U.S. Department of Labor, 200 Constitution Avenue, NW, Room S-3502, Washington, DC 20210.
