**July 2010**

This fact sheet provides general information concerning cooking and baking activities under the federal child laobr provisions. For detailed information about the federal child labor provisions, please read Regulations, [29 CFR Part 570](https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=88f1ece71c2d93fa871def4263ba678c&mc=true&node=pt29.3.570&rgn=div5).

The Department of Labor is committed to helping young workers find positive, appropriate and safe employment experiences. The child labor provisions of the [FLSA](/agencies/whd/flsa) were enacted to ensure that when young people work, the work does not jeopardize their health, well-being or educational opportunities.

## Minimum Age Standards for Employment

The FLSA and the child labor regulations, issued at [29 CFR Part 570](https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=88f1ece71c2d93fa871def4263ba678c&mc=true&node=pt29.3.570&rgn=div5), establish both hours and occupational standards for youth. Youth of any age are generally permitted to work for businesses entirely owned by their parents, except those under 16 may not be employed in mining or manufacturing and no one under 18 may be employed in any occupation the Secretary of Labor has declared to be hazardous.

| **18 Years  of Age** | Once a youth reaches 18 years of age, he or she is no longer subject to the federal child labor provisions. |
| **16 & 17  Years of Age** | Sixteen- and 17-year-olds may be employed for unlimited hours in any occupation other than those declared hazardous by the Secretary of Labor. Examples of equipment declared hazardous and often used by cooks and bakers include power-driven meat processing machines (meat slicers, meat saws, patty forming machines, meat grinders, and meat choppers), commercial mixers and certain power-driven bakery machines. Employees under 18 years of age are not permitted to operate, feed, set-up, adjust, repair, or clean any of these machines. This prohibition includes the hand-washing of the disassembled parts of meat processing machines.   * Sixteen- and 17-year-olds may operate, set up, adjust, repair, oil, and clean lightweight, small capacity, portable, counter-top power-driven mixers that are, or are comparable to, models intended for home use. * Sixteen- and 17-year-olds may operate, but not set up, adjust, repair, oil, or clean, pizza-dough rollers/sheeters that have been constructed with safeguards contained in the basic deign as to prevent fingers, hands, or clothing form being caught in the in-running point of the rollers, have gears that are completed enclosed, and have microswitches that disengage the machinery if the backs or sides of the rollers are removed. |
| **14 & 15  Years of Age** | Fourteen- and 15- year-olds may be employed in food preparation, but they may not perform any baking activities and only limited cooking tasks. There are also restrictions on the number of hours and times of day that these minors may be employed. See [Fact Sheet # 43](/agencies/whd/fact-sheets/43-child-labor-non-agriculture) in this series (*Child Labor Provisions for Nonagricultural Occupations*) for information about these hours standards. |
