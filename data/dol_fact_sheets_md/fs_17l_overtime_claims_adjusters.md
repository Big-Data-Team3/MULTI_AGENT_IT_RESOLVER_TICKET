# Fact Sheet #17L: Insurance Claims Adjusters and the Part 541 Exemptions Under the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA)

**Revised September 2019**

On April 26, 2024, the U.S. Department of Labor (Department) published a final rule, [Defining and Delimiting the Exemptions for Executive, Administrative, Professional, Outside Sales, and Computer Employees](https://www.federalregister.gov/public-inspection/2024-08038/defining-and-delimiting-the-exemptions-for-executive-administrative-professional-outside-sales-and), to update and revise the regulations issued under section 13(a)(1) of the Fair Labor Standards Act implementing the exemption from minimum wage and overtime pay requirements for executive, administrative, and professional employees. Revisions included increases to the standard salary level and the highly compensated employee total annual compensation threshold, and a mechanism for updating these earnings thresholds to reflect current earnings data. On November 15, 2024, the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas vacated the Department's 2024 final rule. Consequently, with regard to enforcement, the Department is applying the 2019 rule's minimum salary level of $684 per week and total annual compensation requirement for highly compensated employees of $107,432 per year. Lawsuits regarding the 2024 final rule are currently pending in two other federal district courts, and the United States has filed a notice of appeal from the November 15 decision. The Department will update this notice with additional information as it becomes available.

This fact sheet provides information on the exemption from minimum wage and overtime pay provided by Section 13(a)(1) of the FLSA as it applies to insurance claims adjusters as discussed in 29 C.F.R. § 541.203(a).

The [FLSA](/agencies/whd/flsa) requires that most employees in the United States be paid at least the [federal minimum wage](/agencies/whd/minimum-wage) for all hours worked and [overtime pay](/agencies/whd/overtimepay) at not less than time and one-half the regular rate of pay for all hours worked over 40 in a workweek.

However, Section 13(a)(1) of the FLSA provides an exemption from both [minimum wage](/agencies/whd/minimum-wage) and [overtime pay](/agencies/whd/overtimepay) for employees employed as bona fide [executive](/agencies/whd/fact-sheets/17b-overtime-executive), [administrative](/agencies/whd/fact-sheets/17c-overtime-administrative), [professional](/agencies/whd/fact-sheets/17d-overtime-professional) and [outside sales](/agencies/whd/fact-sheets/17f-overtime-outside-sales) employees. Section 13(a)(1) and Section 13(a)(17) also exempts certain computer employees. To qualify for exemption, employees must meet certain tests regarding their job duties and be paid on a salary basis at not less than $684 per week.

## Insurance Claims Adjusters

To qualify for the administrative employee exemption, all of the following tests must be met:

* The employee must be compensated on a salary or fee basis (as defined in the regulations) at a rate not less than $684 per week;
* The employee’s primary duty must be the performance of office or non-manual work directly related to the management or general business operations of the employer or the employer’s customers; and
* The employee’s primary duty includes the exercise of discretion and independent judgment with respect to matters of significance.

Whether they work for an insurance company or other type of company, insurance claims adjusters generally meet the duties requirements for the administrative exemption and are not entitled to overtime pay if their duties include activities such as interviewing insureds, witnesses and physicians; inspecting property damage; reviewing factual information to prepare damage estimates; evaluating and making recommendations regarding coverage of claims; determining liability and total value of a claim; negotiating settlements; and making recommendations regarding litigation.

The status of an insurance claims adjuster, however, does not rely on the “claims adjuster” job title alone. There must be a case-by-case assessment to determine whether the employee’s duties meet the requirements for exemption.
