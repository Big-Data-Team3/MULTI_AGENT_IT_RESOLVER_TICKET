# Fact Sheet #28: The Family and Medical Leave Act

**Revised March 2025**

The Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) provides job-protected
leave from work for family and medical reasons. This fact
sheet explains FMLA benefits and protections.

## ABOUT THE FMLA

The FMLA provides eligible employees of covered employers with
job-protected leave for qualifying family and medical reasons
and requires continuation of their group health benefits under
the same conditions as if they had not taken leave. FMLA leave
may be unpaid or used at the same time as employer-provided
paid leave. Employees must be restored to the same or
virtually identical position when they return to work after
FMLA leave.

**Eligible employees:** Employees are eligible if
they work for a covered employer for at least 12 months, have
at least 1,250 hours of service with the employer during the
12 months before their FMLA leave starts, and work at a
location where the employer has at least 50 employees within
75 miles.

**Covered employers:** Covered
employers under the FMLA include:

* Private-sector employers who employ 50 or more employees in
  20 or more workweeks in either the current calendar year or
  previous calendar year,
* Public agencies (including Federal, State, and local
  government employers, regardless of the number of
  employees), and
* Local educational agencies (including public school boards,
  public elementary and secondary schools, and private
  elementary and secondary schools, regardless of the number
  of employees).

**The FMLA protects** leave for:

* The birth of a child or placement of a child with the
  employee for adoption or foster care,
* The care for a child, spouse, or parent who has a serious
  health condition,
* A serious health condition that makes the employee unable to
  work, and
* Reasons related to a family member’s service in the
  military, including
  + Qualifying exigency leave - Leave for certain reasons
    related to a family member’s foreign deployment,
    and
  + Military caregiver leave – leave when a family member is
    a current servicemember or recent veteran with a serious
    injury or illness.

FMLA leave.

## USING FMLA LEAVE

Eligible employees may take:

* Up to 12 workweeks of leave in a 12-month period for any
  FMLA leave reason except military caregiver leave, and
* Up to 26 workweeks of military caregiver leave during a
  single 12-month period.

***Examples:***

* Sheila works 32 hours a week at a shoe store. When Sheila
  needs to take FMLA leave for 12 weeks, she may use up to 32
  hours of FMLA leave a week for 12 weeks.
* Chester works 40 hours a week as an administrative
  assistant. When Chester needs to take FMLA leave for 12
  weeks, he may use up to 40 hours of FMLA leave a week for 12
  weeks.
* Kayden works 50 hours a week as a cook at a restaurant. When
  Kayden needs to take FMLA leave for 12 weeks, he may use up
  to 50 hours of FMLA leave a week for 12 weeks.

**Intermittent or reduced schedule leave.**
Employees have the right to take FMLA leave all at once, or,
when medically necessary, in separate blocks of time or by
reducing the time they work each day or week. Intermittent or
reduced schedule leave is also available for military family
leave reasons. However, employees may use FMLA leave
intermittently or on a reduced leave schedule for bonding with
a newborn or newly placed child only if they and their
employer agree.

***Examples:***

* Sheila has a daughter who serves in the Armed Forces and was
  seriously injured during deployment overseas. Sheila needs
  FMLA leave for one-half of her usual workweek (16 hours)
  over the next six months to assist with her daughter’s care.
* Chester has a serious mental health condition that sometimes
  affects his ability to work. Occasionally, when Chester is
  unable to work because of his mental health, he takes FMLA
  leave, usually for one to three weeks at a time. Chester
  also takes FMLA leave every now and then for an hour or two
  when he has an appointment to see his doctor or attend
  therapy to treat his condition.
* Kayden, a cook, works Tuesday through Saturday. His father,
  Emile, has a serious health condition. Kayden and his wife,
  Maeve, take turns bringing Emile to dialysis during the
  week. Every other Friday evening Kayden uses five hours of
  FMLA leave to help his father. Even though his wife helps,
  Kayden also occasionally uses five hours of FMLA leave on
  other evenings to help his father.

**Paid leave.** FMLA is job-protected, unpaid
leave. Employees may use employer provided paid leave at the
same time that they take FMLA leave if the reason they are
using FMLA leave is covered by the employer’s paid leave
policy. An employer may also require employees to use their
paid leave during FMLA leave.

***Examples:***

* Sheila works for a shoe store that provides her with one
  week of paid vacation time every year. The store always
  requires employees to use their paid vacation time when they
  take time off from work for any reason, even if they are not
  taking a vacation. When Sheila takes 16 hours of FMLA leave
  because of her daughter’s deployment with the Armed Forces
  to a foreign country, her employer pays her for her FMLA
  time off and deducts 16 hours from her one week of vacation
  time.
* When Chester needs FMLA leave for his own serious health
  condition, he uses paid sick leave that is part of his job
  benefits.
* The restaurant where Kayden works provides him paid sick
  leave that he can use for his own health needs but not for
  family care.  Kayden also has other paid time off (PTO)
  that he uses when he takes leave to care for his father who
  has a serious health condition.

**Requesting FMLA leave.**  Employees do not
have to specifically ask for FMLA leave but do need to provide
enough information so the employer is aware the leave may be
covered by the FMLA. Employees must provide notice to their
employer as soon as possible and practical that they will need
to use FMLA leave.  For example, if an employee knows
that he or she has a procedure for a serious medical condition
scheduled in three weeks, the employee needs to provide notice
to the employer as soon as the procedure is scheduled. 
Employers may ask for information from the health care
provider before approving FMLA leave and must allow 15
calendar days to provide the information.   In some
circumstances, such as when the employee’s health care
provider is not able to complete the certification information
timely, employees must be allowed additional time.

## FMLA LEAVE BENEFITS AND PROTECTIONS

**Job protection.** Employees who use FMLA leave
have the right to go back to work at their same job or to an
equivalent job that has the same pay, benefits, and other
terms and conditions of employment at the end of their FMLA
leave. Violations of an employee’s FMLA rights may include
changing the number of shifts assigned to the employee, moving
the employee to a location outside of his or her normal commuting
area, or denying the employee a bonus for which the employee qualified
before taking FMLA leave.

An employer cannot threaten, discriminate against, punish,
suspend, or fire an employee because he or she requested or used
FMLA leave. Violations of an employee’s FMLA rights may
include actions such as writing up the employee for missing
work when using FMLA leave, denying a promotion because the
employee has used FMLA leave, or assessing negative attendance
points for FMLA leave use.

**Group health plan benefits.** Employers are required to continue group health insurance
coverage for an employee on FMLA leave under the same terms
and conditions as if the employee had not taken leave. For
example, if family member coverage is provided to an
employee, family member coverage must be maintained during
the employee’s FMLA leave.

## SPECIAL FMLA RULES FOR SOME WORKERS

FMLA Leave and Teachers.  Special rules apply to
employees of elementary schools, secondary schools, and school
boards. Generally, these rules apply when an employee needs
intermittent leave or leave near the end of a school term.

FMLA Eligibility for Flight Crews.  Airline flight crew
employees have special hours of service eligibility
requirements. For more information about the special rules for
flight crew employees, see
[Fact Sheet #28J](/agencies/whd/fact-sheets/28j-fmla-airline-crew).

## FMLA Eligibility for Servicemembers under the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act (USERRA)

Returning servicemembers are entitled to receive all rights
and benefits of employment that they would have obtained if
they had been continuously employed. Any period of absence
from work due to USERRA-covered service counts toward an
employee’s months and hours of service requirements for FMLA
leave eligibility.

## ADDITIONAL PROTECTIONS

### State Laws

Some States have their own family and medical leave laws.
Nothing in the FMLA prevents employees from receiving
protections under other laws. Workers have the right to
benefit from all the laws that apply.

### Protection from Retaliation

FMLA is a federal worker protection law.  Employers are
prohibited from interfering with, restraining, or denying the
exercise of, or the attempt to exercise, any FMLA right. Any
violations of the FMLA or the FMLA regulations constitute
interfering with, restraining, or denying the exercise of
rights provided by the FMLA. For more information about
prohibited employer retaliation under the FMLA, see
[Fact Sheet #77B](/agencies/whd/fact-sheets/77b-fmla-protections)
and
[Field Assistance Bulletin 2022-2](/sites/dolgov/files/WHD/fab/fab-2022-2.pdf).

### Enforcement

The Wage and Hour Division is responsible for administering
and enforcing the FMLA for most employees. If you believe that
your rights under the FMLA have been violated, you may file a
complaint with the Wage and Hour Division or file a private
lawsuit against your employer in court. State employees may be
subject to certain limitations in pursuit of direct lawsuits
regarding leave for their own serious health conditions. Most
Federal and certain congressional employees are also covered
by the law but are subject to the jurisdiction of the U.S.
Office of Personnel Management or Congress.
