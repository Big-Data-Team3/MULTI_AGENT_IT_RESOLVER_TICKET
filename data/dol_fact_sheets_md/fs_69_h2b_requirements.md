The H-2B provisions of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) provide for the admission of nonimmigrants to the U.S. to perform temporary non-agricultural labor or services. [8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(15)(H)(ii)(b)]

The Wage and Hour Division (WHD) of the U.S. Department of Labor (Department) has been delegated enforcement responsibility to ensure H-2B workers are employed in compliance with H-2B labor certification requirements.

The Department’s regulations implementing this authority became effective on January 18, 2009, and are applicable to applications for certifications filed on or after that date pursuant to 20 C.F.R.

### Notice
