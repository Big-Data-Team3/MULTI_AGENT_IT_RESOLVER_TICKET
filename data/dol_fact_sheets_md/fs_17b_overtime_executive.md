# Fact Sheet #17B: Exemption for Executive Employees Under the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA)

**Revised August 2024**

On April 26, 2024, the U.S. Department of Labor (Department) published a final rule, [Defining and Delimiting the Exemptions for Executive, Administrative, Professional, Outside Sales, and Computer Employees](https://www.federalregister.gov/public-inspection/2024-08038/defining-and-delimiting-the-exemptions-for-executive-administrative-professional-outside-sales-and), to update and revise the regulations issued under section 13(a)(1) of the Fair Labor Standards Act implementing the exemption from minimum wage and overtime pay requirements for executive, administrative, and professional employees. Revisions included increases to the standard salary level and the highly compensated employee total annual compensation threshold, and a mechanism for updating these earnings thresholds to reflect current earnings data. On November 15, 2024, the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas vacated the Department's 2024 final rule. Consequently, with regard to enforcement, the Department is applying the 2019 rule's minimum salary level of $684 per week and total annual compensation requirement for highly compensated employees of $107,432 per year. Lawsuits regarding the 2024 final rule are currently pending in two other federal district courts, and the United States has filed a notice of appeal from the November 15 decision. The Department will update this notice with additional information as it becomes available.

This fact sheet provides information on the exemption from minimum wage and overtime pay provided by Section 13(a)(1) of the FLSA as defined by regulations at [29 CFR part 541](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-29/subtitle-B/chapter-V/subchapter-A/part-541), as applied to executive employees.

The [FLSA](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/flsa) requires that most employees in the United States be paid at least the [federal minimum wage](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/minimum-wage) for all hours worked and [overtime pay](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/overtimepay) at not less than time and one-half the regular rate of pay for all hours worked over 40 hours in a workweek.

However, Section 13(a)(1) of the FLSA provides an exemption from both [minimum wage](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/minimum-wage) and [overtime pay](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/overtimepay) for employees employed as bona fide [executive](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/fact-sheets/17b-overtime-executive), [administrative](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/fact-sheets/17c-overtime-administrative), [professional](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/fact-sheets/17d-overtime-professional) and [outside sales](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/fact-sheets/17f-overtime-outside-sales) employees. Section 13(a)(1) and Section 13(a)(17) also exempt employees in certain computer-related occupations. Job titles do not determine exemption status. In order for an exemption to apply, an employee's specific job duties and salary must meet the requirements of the Department's regulations. The standard salary level can be found in [29 CFR 541.600](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-29/subtitle-B/chapter-V/subchapter-A/part-541/subpart-G/section-541.600) and listed at <https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/overtime/salary-levels>.

See other fact sheets in this series for more information on the exemptions for [administrative](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/fact-sheets/17c-overtime-administrative), [professional](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/fact-sheets/17d-overtime-professional), [computer](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/fact-sheets/17e-overtime-computer) and [outside sales](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/fact-sheets/17f-overtime-outside-sales) employees, and for more information on the [salary basis](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/fact-sheets/17g-overtime-salary) requirement.

## Executive Exemption

To qualify for the executive employee exemption, the employer must ensure all of the following requirements are met:

* The employee must be compensated on a [salary basis](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/fact-sheets/17g-overtime-salary) (as defined in the regulations) at a rate not less than the standard salary level required by [29 CFR 541.600](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-29/subtitle-B/chapter-V/subchapter-A/part-541/subpart-G/section-541.600) and listed at <https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/overtime/salary-levels>;
* The employee's primary duty must be managing the enterprise, or managing a customarily recognized department or subdivision of the enterprise;
* The employee must customarily and regularly direct the work of two or more other full-time employees or their equivalent; and
* The employee must have the authority to hire or fire other employees, or the employee's suggestions and recommendations as to the hiring, firing, advancement, promotion or any other change of status of other employees must be given particular weight.

## Primary Duty

"Primary duty" means the principal, main, major or most important duty that the employee performs. Determination of an employee's primary duty must be based on all the facts in a particular case, with the major emphasis on the character of the employee's job as a whole.

## Management

Generally, "management" includes, but is not limited to, activities such as interviewing, selecting, and training of employees; setting and adjusting their rates of pay and hours of work; directing the work of employees; maintaining production or sales records for use in supervision or control; appraising employees' productivity and efficiency for the purpose of recommending promotions or other changes in status; handling employee complaints and grievances; disciplining employees; planning the work; determining the techniques to be used; apportioning the work among the employees; determining the type of materials, supplies, machinery, equipment or tools to be used or merchandise to be bought, stocked and sold; controlling the flow and distribution of materials or merchandise and supplies; providing for the safety and security of the employees or the property; planning and controlling the budget; and monitoring or implementing legal compliance measures.

## Department or Subdivision

The phrase "a customarily recognized department or subdivision" is intended to distinguish between a mere collection of employees assigned from time to time to a specific job or series of jobs and a unit with permanent status and function.

## Customarily and Regularly

The phrase "customarily and regularly" means greater than occasional but less than constant; it includes work normally done every workweek, but does not include isolated or one-time tasks.

## Two or More

The phrase "two or more other employees" means two full-time employees or their equivalent. For example, one full-time and two half-time employees are equivalent to two full-time employees. The supervision can be distributed among two, three or more employees, but each such employee must customarily and regularly direct the work of two or more other full-time employees or the equivalent. For example, a department with five full-time nonexempt workers may have up to two exempt supervisors if each supervisor directs the work of two of those workers.

## Particular Weight

Factors to be considered in determining whether an employee's recommendations as to hiring, firing, advancement, promotion or any other change of status are given "particular weight" include, but are not limited to, whether it is part of the employee's job duties to make such recommendations, and the frequency with which such recommendations are made, requested, and relied upon. Generally, an executive's recommendations must pertain to employees whom the executive customarily and regularly directs. It does not include occasional suggestions. An employee's recommendations may still be deemed to have "particular weight" even if a higher level manager's recommendation has more importance and even if the employee does not have authority to make the ultimate decision as to the employee's change in status.

## Exemption of Business Owners

Under a special rule for business owners, an employee who owns at least a bona fide 20-percent equity interest in the enterprise in which employed, regardless of the type of business organization (e.g., corporation, partnership, or other), and who is actively engaged in its management, is considered a bona fide exempt executive. The salary level and salary basis requirements do not apply to such business owners.

## Highly Compensated Employees

[Highly compensated employees](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/fact-sheets/17h-overtime-highly-compensated) performing office or non-manual work and who meet the compensation requirements provided in [29 CFR 541.601](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-29/subtitle-B/chapter-V/subchapter-A/part-541/subpart-G/section-541.601) and listed at <https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/overtime/salary-levels> are exempt from the FLSA's minimum wage and overtime requirements if they customarily and regularly perform at least one of the duties of an exempt executive, administrative or professional employee identified in the standard tests for exemption.
